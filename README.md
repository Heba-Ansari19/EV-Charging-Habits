# EV-Charging-Habits

Exploring electric vehicle charging habits, focusing on patterns, peak usage times, charging station demand, and user behavior insights to support sustainable transportation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview
As electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, access to charging stations (ports) is becoming increasingly important. Many modern apartment buildings are retrofitting their parking garages with **shared charging stations** accessible to all tenants.  

However, with rising demand comes competition ‚Äî it‚Äôs frustrating to come home and find no charging spots available!  

This project analyzes EV charging data to help **apartment building managers** better understand tenants‚Äô charging habits and optimize charging station availability.

## üéØ Objectives / Key Questions
- Find the number of unique individuals that use each garage‚Äôs **shared charging stations**.  
- Identify the **top 10 most popular charging start times** (by weekday and hour) for shared charging sessions.  
- Find users whose **average charging duration exceeds 10 hours** on shared stations.
